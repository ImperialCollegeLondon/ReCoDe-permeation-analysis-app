# ReCode: Time Lag Analysis Application

## Purpose of this Exemplar

This exemplar serves as a learning tool for understanding how to design and structure scientific software. It is not intended to teach Python programming from scratch, but rather to demonstrate thoughtful software design practices in a research context.

The application analyses gas permeation through membrane materials using the time-lag methodâ€”a technique commonly used in materials science and chemical engineering. Through this specific application, you'll learn broadly applicable principles of scientific software design.

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure a scientific application with clear separation of concerns
- Techniques for processing experimental data
- Implementation of numerical methods (PDE solving)
- Approaches for data visualisation with matplotlib
- Building user interfaces for scientific applications
- Testing scientific software
- Documentation best practices

## Before You Begin

This exemplar assumes you have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with scientific computing concepts
- Understanding of numerical methods fundamentals
- Experience with plotting data

## Major Steps in this Time Lag Analysis App

The implementation follows these key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing** - Loading experimental data files and preparing data for analysis
2. **Stabilization Time Detection** - Identifying when the system reaches steady-state permeation
3. **Linear Regression of Steady-State Data** - Fitting the steady-state portion of the flux curve
4. **Time Lag Calculation** - Determining the time lag from the linear regression
5. **Diffusion Coefficient Determination** - Calculating diffusion coefficient from time lag
6. **Permeability and Solubility Calculation** - Computing additional transport parameters
7. **PDE-Based Validation** - Numerically solving the diffusion equation to validate results
8. **Visualisation** - Creating plots and visual representations of the analysis
9. **Workflow Integration** - Combining all steps into a cohesive analysis pipeline
10. **GUI Implementation** - Building a user-friendly interface to the analysis tools
