# ReCode: Time Lag Analysis Application


## Purpose of this Exemplar

This exemplar serves as a learning tool for understanding how to design and structure scientific software. It is not intended to teach Python programming from scratch, but rather to demonstrate thoughtful software design practices in a research context.


The application analyses gas permeation through membrane materials using the time-lag methodâ€”a technique commonly used in materials science and chemical engineering. Through this specific application, you'll learn broadly applicable principles of scientific software design.

## What You'll Learn

- How to structure a scientific application with clear separation of concerns
- Techniques for processing experimental data
- Implementation of numerical methods (PDE solving)
- Approaches for data visualisation with matplotlib
- Building user interfaces for scientific applications
- Testing scientific software
- Documentation best practices

## Before You Begin

This exemplar assumes you have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with scientific computing concepts
- Understanding of numerical methods fundamentals
- Experience with plotting data
