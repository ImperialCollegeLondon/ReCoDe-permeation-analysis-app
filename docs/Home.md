# Time Lag Analysis Application Wiki

Welcome to the Time Lag Analysis Application documentation. This application helps to analyse gas permeation data through membrane materials using the time-lag method.

## Purpose

Commercial software in chemical engineering often operates as a "black box," limiting users' understanding and customization options. This application demonstrates how these functionalities can be recreated transparently, empowering users to develop solutions that directly address their specific needs while gaining deeper insights into the underlying models.

The time-lag analysis demonstrated here serves as an excellent template, as its principles apply across various chemical engineering disciplines - from process engineering to electrochemical applications. This versatility makes it an ideal starting point for adaptation to different research contexts.

Rather than implementing complex software architecture, this project prioritises accessibility and clarity. It provides a straightforward template that researchers can easily understand and modify, regardless of their programming experience. The result is a customizable tool that offers transparency and flexibility unavailable in commercial alternatives, enabling researchers to create tailored solutions for their specific research requirements.
