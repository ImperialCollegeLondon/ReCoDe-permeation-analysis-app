# Theory of Time Lag Analysis

## Basic Principles

The time-lag method is used to determine gas transport properties in membrane materials:
- Diffusion coefficient (D)
- Permeability coefficient (P)
- Solubility coefficient (S)

## Mathematical Framework

1. Time Lag Definition
   - The time lag (θ) is determined from the intersection of the steady-state asymptote with the time axis
   - θ = L²/6D, where L is membrane thickness

2. Key Parameters
   - D = L²/6θ (diffusion coefficient)
   - P = J×L/Δp (permeability coefficient)
   - S = P/D (solubility coefficient)

Where:
- L = membrane thickness
- J = steady-state flux
- Δp = pressure difference
